The Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy has helped me nurture my knowledge 
in Computer Science and given me the confidence to explore these skills further down 
the career line. The academy gave me the opportunity to attend coding (Python) workshops at UC Berkeley 
that roused my eagerness to explore more coding languages, including HTML, CSS, and Java, 
in the future. I mastered graphics in Python and made everlasting relationships with some
of my Berkeley peers. Some components of graphics I learned included the color spectrum (rgb)
used in coding and Mandelbrot/Julia graphics. I also visited the Solar Bos company, 
a solar energy equipment supplier in Livermore. 
I was able to use my knowledge I gained from this experience on my upcoming Engineering
project (which can be viewed in the Projects tab of this website), which focused on building 
solar cell vehicles in addition to vehicles powered by hydrogen cells.

I attended two speeches presented by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientists 
last month. A speech that especially blew my mind was about Accelerator Mass Spectrometer 
machines, which was presented by Dr. Michael Malfatti. I actually learned about a variety
of simple machines in my Engineering class a few months ago and this presentation combined
all of my knowledge together. Seeing an actual machine that is widely used in 
the world fascinated me. I never knew that pulleys can be used in a complex 
machine that specializes in developing new drugs or doing low dose toxicology tests.
I also had the privilege of meeting Maynard Holliday who is currently a senior 
engineer at Rand Corporation and was a government advisor in the 2015 Defense Science Board 
and the Pentagon. He is also involved in former president Barack Obama's My Brother's 
Keeper iniative, that focuses on increasing opportunities for young people. I 
got inspired to continue learning engineering when he described his engineering work
as the Under Secretary of Defense senior technical advisor, including his job of giving
input on the sustainment and development aspects for his project.

As a student of the Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High School, I have the opportunity to 
participate in the Engineering Mentorship Program. My mentor is Jayati Sengupta,
the co-founder and CMO of CareerWaze. She is currently helping me strengthen my resume
and plan my career goals. I am ever so thankful to 
have Jayati as my mentor, as she is helping me plan for my future.

You will either find me working in my office or volunteering at a local hospital.
I am the founder of You and I Give, an organization where we raise funds for local hospitals. 
Our current project is to raise $1000 for terminally ill children at George 
Mark Children's House. This amount will be used to provide financial support 
to cover patients' costs of hydrotherapy sessions, bereavement for families, 
and medical devices. I am also in the process of starting an e-commerce company that enables people to 
express their love to their loved ones in a tangible, personalized, comical way.
I raised $10K from friends and family. So far, I iterated on several versions 
of Business Model Canvas and devised a marketing plan to pull in traffic to my 
website from social media sites. I defined the software requirements and am working 
to get software developed. I am currently evaluating options for logistics, printing, 
packaging and shipping.
